# OkotPascal-Loan-Book-Dataset-2024_2025
Using the Loan book dataset;
1. create a variable called Performance based on the Loan Account Status (Good is when the status is matured or performing, else the loan is Bad)
2. Design a one page dashboard (or a collection of several graphics) using a tool of your choice (PowerBI, Tableau, Excel, Google Sheets, R, Python, etc.) to help portfolio managers explore the different factors driving the performance of the book.
3. Using 1 and 2 above, develop a logistic model (or any other model of choice) to help predict loan Performance. The model will be used by several teams in identifying good customers to be given better loan terms but also support timely recovery efforts (Please note that the whole dataset is a training dataset, and you don’t have to test its accuracy on a testing dataset).
4. Design a portfolio summary presentation to the Credit Committee of the Board – max of 2 PowerPoint Slides.
Slide 1: Using Macroeconomic dataset, describe macroeconomic outlook for Uganda and advise management on lending strategies to consider given the outlook
Slide 2: Using results from Section A, describe the Portfolio Summary Performance and Strategies/credit policy changes to improve book performance.
NB. For the Macroeconomic Dataset, please consider the last 12months only.
